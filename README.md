### Overview

The `ormar` package is an async mini ORM for Python, with support for **Postgres,
MySQL**, and **SQLite**. 

The main benefit of using `ormar` are:

*  getting an **async ORM that can be used with async frameworks** (fastapi, starlette etc.)
*  getting just **one model to maintain** - you don't have to maintain pydantic and other orm model (sqlalchemy, peewee, gino etc.)

The goal was to create a simple ORM that can be **used directly (as request and response models) with [`fastapi`][fastapi]** that bases it's data validation on pydantic.

Ormar - apart form obvious ORM in name - get it's name from ormar in swedish which means snakes, and ormar(e) in italian which means cabinet. 

And what's a better name for python ORM than snakes cabinet :)

**If you like ormar remember to star the repository in [github](https://github.com/collerek/ormar)!**

The bigger community we build, the easier it will be to catch bugs and attract contributors ;)

### Documentation

Check out the [documentation][documentation] for details.

**Note that for brevity most of the documentation snippets omit the creation of the database
and scheduling the execution of functions for asynchronous run.**

If you want more real life examples than in the documentation you can see [tests][tests] folder,
since they actually have to create and connect to database in most of the tests.

Yet remember that those are - well - tests and not all solutions are suitable to be used in real life applications.

### Part of the `fastapi` ecosystem

As part of the fastapi ecosystem `ormar` is supported in libraries that somehow work with databases.

As of now `ormar` is supported by:

*  [`fastapi-users`](https://github.com/frankie567/fastapi-users)
*  [`fastapi-crudrouter`](https://github.com/awtkns/fastapi-crudrouter)
*  [`fastapi-pagination`](https://github.com/uriyyo/fastapi-pagination)

If you maintain or use different library and would like it to support `ormar` let us know how we can help.

### Dependencies

Ormar is built with:

  * [`sqlalchemy core`][sqlalchemy-core] for query building.
  * [`databases`][databases] for cross-database async support.
  * [`pydantic`][pydantic] for data validation.
  * `typing_extensions` for python 3.6 - 3.7

### License

`ormar` is built as an open-sorce software and remain completely free (MIT license).

As I write open-source code to solve everyday problems in my work or to promote and build strong python 
community you can say thank you and buy me a coffee or sponsor me with a monthly amount to help ensure my work remains free and maintained.

### Migrating from `sqlalchemy` and existing databases

If you currently use `sqlalchemy` and would like to switch to `ormar` check out the auto-translation
tool that can help you with translating existing sqlalchemy orm models so you do not have to do it manually.

**Beta** versions available at github: [`sqlalchemy-to-ormar`](https://github.com/collerek/sqlalchemy-to-ormar)
or simply `pip install sqlalchemy-to-ormar`

`sqlalchemy-to-ormar` can be used in pair with `sqlacodegen` to auto-map/ generate `ormar` models from existing database, even if you don't use the `sqlalchemy` for your project.

### Migrations & Database creation

Because ormar is built on SQLAlchemy core, you can use [`alembic`][alembic] to provide
database migrations (and you really should for production code).

For tests and basic applications the `sqlalchemy` is more than enough:
```python
# note this is just a partial snippet full working example below
# 1. Imports
import sqlalchemy
import databases

# 2. Initialization
DATABASE_URL = "sqlite:///db.sqlite"
database = databases.Database(DATABASE_URL)
metadata = sqlalchemy.MetaData()

# Define models here

# 3. Database creation and tables creation
engine = sqlalchemy.create_engine(DATABASE_URL)
metadata.create_all(engine)
```

For a sample configuration of alembic and more information regarding migrations and 
database creation visit [migrations][migrations] documentation section.

### Package versions
**ormar is still under development:**
We recommend pinning any dependencies (with i.e. `ormar~=0.9.1`)

`ormar` also follows the release numeration that breaking changes bump the major number, 
while other changes and fixes bump minor number, so with the latter you should be safe to
update, yet always read the [releases][releases] docs before.
`example: (0.5.2 -> 0.6.0 - breaking, 0.5.2 -> 0.5.3 - non breaking)`.

### Asynchronous Python

Note that `ormar` is an asynchronous ORM, which means that you have to `await` the calls to 
the methods, that are scheduled for execution in an event loop. Python has a builtin module
[`asyncio`][asyncio] that allows you to do just that.

Note that most of "normal" python interpreters do not allow execution of `await` 
outside of a function (cause you actually schedule this function for delayed execution 
and don't get the result immediately).

In a modern web frameworks (like `fastapi`), the framework will handle this for you, but if
you plan to do this on your own you need to perform this manually like described in a 
quick start below.

### Quick Start

Note that you can find the same script in examples folder on github.

```python
from typing import Optional

import databases
import pydantic

import ormar
import sqlalchemy

DATABASE_URL = "sqlite:///db.sqlite"
database = databases.Database(DATABASE_URL)
metadata = sqlalchemy.MetaData()


# note that this step is optional -> all ormar cares is a internal
# class with name Meta and proper parameters, but this way you do not
# have to repeat the same parameters if you use only one database
class BaseMeta(ormar.ModelMeta):
    metadata = metadata
    database = database


# Note that all type hints are optional
# below is a perfectly valid model declaration
# class Author(ormar.Model):
#     class Meta(BaseMeta):
#         tablename = "authors"
#
#     id = ormar.Integer(primary_key=True) # <= notice no field types
#     name = ormar.String(max_length=100)

class Author(ormar.Model):
    class Meta(BaseMeta):
        tablename = "authors"

    id: int = ormar.Integer(primary_key=True)
    name: str = ormar.String(max_length=100)


class Book(ormar.Model):
    class Meta(BaseMeta):
        tablename = "books"

    id: int = ormar.Integer(primary_key=True)
    author: Optional[Author] = ormar.ForeignKey(Author)
    title: str = ormar.String(max_length=100)
    year: int = ormar.Integer(nullable=True)


# create the database
# note that in production you should use migrations
# note that this is not required if you connect to existing database
engine = sqlalchemy.create_engine(DATABASE_URL)
# just to be sure we clear the db before
metadata.drop_all(engine)
metadata.create_all(engine)

# be awaited on their own

#### Relation types

*  One to many  - with `ForeignKey(to: Model)`
*  Many to many - with `ManyToMany(to: Model, Optional[through]: Model)`

#### Model fields types

Available Model Fields (with required args - optional ones in docs):

* `String(max_length)`
* `Text()`
* `Boolean()`
* `Integer()`
* `Float()`
* `Date()`
* `Time()`
* `DateTime()`
* `JSON()`
* `BigInteger()`
* `Decimal(scale, precision)`
* `UUID()`
* `LargeBinary(max_length)`
* `EnumField` - by passing `choices` to any other Field type
* `EncryptedString` - by passing `encrypt_secret` and `encrypt_backend`
* `ForeignKey(to)`
* `ManyToMany(to, through)`

### Available fields options
The following keyword arguments are supported on all field types.

  * `primary_key: bool`
  * `nullable: bool`
  * `default: Any`
  * `server_default: Any`
  * `index: bool`
  * `unique: bool`
  * `choices: typing.Sequence`
  * `name: str`
  * `pydantic_only: bool`

All fields are required unless one of the following is set:

  * `nullable` - Creates a nullable column. Sets the default to `None`.
  * `default` - Set a default value for the field. **Not available for relation fields**
  * `server_default` - Set a default value for the field on server side (like sqlalchemy's `func.now()`). **Not available for relation fields**
  * `primary key` with `autoincrement` - When a column is set to primary key and autoincrement is set on this column. 
Autoincrement is set by default on int primary keys. 
  * `pydantic_only` - Field is available only as normal pydantic field, not stored in the database.
  
### Available signals

Signals allow to trigger your function for a given event on a given Model.

  * `pre_save`
  * `post_save`
  * `pre_update`
  * `post_update`
  * `pre_delete`
  * `post_delete`
